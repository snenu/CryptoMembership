🥇 CryptoMembership  

Decentralized Membership & Access Platform

1️⃣ What is CryptoMembership  ?

CryptoMembership   is a Web3 alternative to Patreon, Discord subscriptions, and paid communities.

It allows creators or communities to:

Create paid memberships

Lock content / access behind crypto payments

Accept payment in ANY crypto

Use wallet-based access, not emails/passwords

It allows users to:

Join memberships easily

Pay using any crypto they already own

Prove membership via wallet (NFT-based)

2️⃣ Problem This Project Solves
❌ Current Problems

Patreon blocks many regions

Stripe doesn’t support crypto well

Subscriptions are centralized

Users lose access if account is banned

No ownership of membership

✅ Our Solution

Wallet-based membership

NFT = proof of access

Polygon = cheap & fast

SideShift = chain-agnostic payments

No platform lock-in

3️⃣ Who are the users?

Only 2 user types 👇

👤 1. Creator / Community Owner

Creates a membership

Sets price

Uploads content

Controls access

👥 2. Member / User

Browses memberships

Pays for membership

Gets access automatically

4️⃣ High-Level How It Works
Creator creates membership
        ↓
Membership page goes live
        ↓
User selects membership
        ↓
User pays with ANY crypto
        ↓
SideShift → USDC (Polygon)
        ↓
Membership NFT minted
        ↓
Access unlocked

5️⃣ How Polygon is used (CORE PART)

Polygon is the core blockchain layer.

🔗 Polygon is used for:
🪪 1. Membership NFTs

When user subscribes → NFT is minted

NFT proves:

User is a valid member

Membership tier

No NFT = no access.

💰 2. Payments in USDC

Membership prices are in USDC

Creator receives stable income

Cheap gas fees

🔐 3. Access Control

Website checks:

Wallet connected

NFT ownership

Only NFT holders can access private pages

6️⃣ How SideShift API is used

SideShift removes payment friction.

❌ Without SideShift

User must own USDC on Polygon

Many users don’t

✅ With SideShift
Payment Flow

User clicks Join Membership

Selects crypto (ETH / BTC / SOL / etc.)

SideShift:

Converts crypto → USDC

Sends USDC to Polygon smart contract

Contract mints Membership NFT

👉 User pays in ANY crypto
👉 Creator always receives USDC

7️⃣ Role of Pinata (IPFS)

Pinata is used for decentralized content storage.

Stored on IPFS:

Membership metadata

Cover images

Gated content metadata

NFT metadata

Why IPFS?

Censorship-resistant

Permanent

Decentralized

8️⃣ Role of MongoDB

MongoDB is used for off-chain data:

Stored in MongoDB:

User profiles

Creator dashboards

Membership listings

Content indexing

Search filters

Blockchain ≠ database
Mongo keeps app fast & scalable.
